**Simple Slides** is a <span style="color: #ff7b00">**responsive**</span> and
<span style="color: #ff7b00">**text-first**</span> presentation tool

that keeps your audience <span style="color: #0084ff;">**engaged**</span>.

With **Simple Slides**, each slide will expand
the content to its
maximum possible size

Based on your browser window

Resize your window and try it!

See!

This style means less content
per slide

And faster changing of slides

Notice the bar on the bottom
of the screen too

It measures your progress

You can refresh the page,
and your current slide will stick. Try it!

You can even share the URL,
and it will load at the current slide

**Simple Slides** uses
**markdown** to render slides

So you can use things like:

# Headings
On top of content

- bulleted
- lists

1. or numbered lists
1. if that's
1. how you roll

```
const code = "your nifty code here";
code++; // wat
```

And whatever else
markdown supports!

That said, we ***do*** recommend creating an account.

Signing up lets you:

[Here's an example](https://v2.simpleslides.dev/thecodeboss/why-give-talks)
of a real presentation

And when creating your first presentation,

You can use [these instructions](/instructions.md) themselves as an example!

Finally, there are a few more
hot keys than just the arrow keys:

```
j or l = go forward 1 slide
k or h = go back 1 slide
f = go forward 5 slides
b = go back 5 slides
0 = go to start
$ = go to end
```

That's it! Thanks for reading
these instructions!

You have a great
day now, buh bye

And go create something awesome!

Special thanks to my
original inspiration:

A similar desktop-only tool
called [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/)

Now, the next slide is
the last slide for real
